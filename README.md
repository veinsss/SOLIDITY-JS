Simple Token Contract using Remix IDE

This guide walks you through the process of deploying a simple token contract using the Remix IDE. Follow the steps below to compile, deploy, and execute the contract.
Prerequisites

    Remix IDE: Visit Remix IDE to access the Ethereum smart contract development environment.
    MetaMask (Optional): To interact with live Ethereum networks, you might need a MetaMask wallet. For testing, the Remix environment provides a local blockchain.

Token Contract (test.sol)

    Open Remix IDE in your browser.
    In the file explorer, create a new Solidity file called test.sol.
    Paste the Solidity code for your token contract into the file.

Compilation

    In the left panel, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab (looks like a gavel).
    Select the appropriate Solidity compiler version (ensure it matches the version your contract is written in).
    Click the "Compile test.sol" button to compile the contract.
        If there are any errors, check the console and make the necessary fixes.

Deployment

    After successful compilation, go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (looks like a computer monitor).
    Choose an environment:
        JavaScript VM: For testing locally.
        Injected Web3: To deploy on a live network using MetaMask.
    Select the contract you want to deploy from the dropdown (if there are multiple contracts in your test.sol file).
    Click the "Deploy" button.
        The contract will be deployed, and you’ll see it appear under the “Deployed Contracts” section.

Interacting with the Deployed Contract

    Once deployed, you can interact with your contract directly from the Remix IDE.
    Under the “Deployed Contracts” section, expand your contract to view available functions.
    Click on a function to execute it. For example:
        totalSupply: To check the total supply of tokens.
        balanceOf: To check a specific address's token balance.
        transfer: To transfer tokens between addresses.

Summary

You’ve successfully deployed a simple token contract using the Remix IDE! From here, you can further test, modify, and build upon the contract.
