# Simple Token Contract using Remix IDE

This guide walks you through the process of deploying a simple token contract using the Remix IDE. Follow the steps below to compile, deploy, and execute the contract.
Prerequisites

    Remix IDE: Remix IDE (web-based development environment for Ethereum smart contracts).
    MetaMask (Optional): To interact with live Ethereum networks, you might need MetaMask. For testing, Remix provides a local blockchain environment.

# Steps
1. Create a Solidity File

    Open Remix IDE in your browser.
    In the file explorer, create a new Solidity file called test.sol.
    Paste your Solidity code into the test.sol file.

2. Compile the Contract

    In the left panel, click on the Solidity Compiler tab
    Select the appropriate compiler version (ensure it matches your Solidity code).
    Click the Compile test.sol button to compile the contract.
        Fix any compilation errors by checking the console.
